Interview Questions,out of 5,,out of 5,,out of 5,
Goal; Complete your dating profile,TRUE,"American is not an ethnicity. 
What's the difference between hometown and location?
Should be able to skip college.
Should be able to skip religion.
Would prefer to see a list of religions. Someone could put cheese as your religion (which I would be in awe of)
How many shows should I be selecting? 
Would have chosen ""I don't think any of these are funny"" 
Not very into stand up comedy (would have liked to skip this option)
Maybe ask upfront what kind of things make you laugh and then be more specific about the ones you've selected.
""Where do you go for funny content?""
Not clear at first why you're picking a prompt.
Will there be a problem with fuck, marry, kill?
In general, need more context aorund the prompts",TRUE,"IG only - needs explanation
Feels like it's going to be very long (onboarding) process
As a male, height sucks (reason this is important) - Why only inches - Next needs to be on num pad
Maybe show the profile at once - and show what you need to fill out - Tinder you can connect with FB and start swiping, how do we expedite this?
EXPLAIN
Location - don't need map
Dating pref - move up
Ethnicity - risky, should be dropdown - Probably remove
Family preference - skip / prefer not to say are same thing
Hometown redudandant
Religion - no good, text, so long
Loves 'pick a show'
Pick a meme is great 
Pick a platform - kinda cool
Pick a prompt - not sure what that is - iconography weird, how is it actually going to be used? (title says FMK on 'would you rather' - and no one wants to enter text') - didn't know need to enter a comment
6 is a lot of photos
Profile should be shown after humor, then add all the other stuff 
Picture first, but app that connects you on humor


Go to the cheese (live dates) first -> pay people to go on dates, get people in quickly to that, then at the time of going to your queue, complete profile.",TRUE,"""Hometown, that's fun""
Is all of this info going to be shown on your profile right away? A lot of personal info for people you may not want to match with with
""Oh this is fun"" (humor quiz)
'Pick a prompt' makes sense, but still not 100% sure how it will appear on your profile
Short bio or best 1liner to add to profile to represent humor
I really like this concept"
Targets / Questions:,,,,,,
"On a scale of 1-5... how much did you enjoy the HumorMe onboarding process? (1 being ""I did not enjoy it at all"", 5 being ""I enjoyed it a lot"")
Please expand.",4,"Liked chooding a meme. It was way too long, but could be avoided if there were skip buttons.",2,"Never lost
Too many steps
Context around why questions were asked was missing",3,"It's easier than Tinder/Bumble because you don't need to write your own stuff
