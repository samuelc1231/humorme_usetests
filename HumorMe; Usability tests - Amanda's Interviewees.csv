This requires having references to real life things.
Like the prompts sections.
Job does not match up on profile",TRUE,"Example Asian looks like ""Ex-Asian""
Didn't know to scroll.
Memes were a lot to read.
""Fuck"" is a bad word.
",TRUE,"""Why do you have to put in your height?""
First question after name is height is bizarre -- makes it seem like not about humor

College should also be skipable
Religion should also be skipable

""These are all white people shows""
Tried to pick ""Other""

Liked pick a prompt, but said half of them feel ""very high school""

Please expand.",3,"""I didn't find most of the things relatable in the options they gave me. But it did give me the option to enter my own which was a good thing""",4,"""It felt like making. aprofile but it was definitely more fun than making a profile on Tinder""
""I liked not having to make something from nothing""",3,Making the profile isn't the fun part. Wasn't super tedious compared to OKCupid. Amount of personal information was good.,3,Just like any other onboarding. Gotta be done and I respect that.,2,"
The memes, comedians, TV show are good categories, but the content needs to be more niche and current. Feels very hello, fellow kids, which is a huge turn off.",3,"""It doesn't feel particularly different from any other onboarding experience I've had with a dating app.""",1,"""It was pretty regular and boring. Felt like every other dating app onboarding I've ever done in my life"""
"On a scale of 1-5... how easy was it to achieve the goal of creating your dating profile? (1 being ""very difficult"", 5 being ""super easy"")
Please expand.",5,It was very easy,3,"You have to think about your preferences when it comes to humor. Thinking about what's funny.
Tinder is really easy but there's no investment in differentiating your profile. ""It feels like everyone's the same when I'm on it""",5,Questions were easy to answer. ,4,"Usually it would take longer, but easier than average because there were fewer questions.",5,"Very simple process, which was good. College and job should be skippable.",4,Couldn't give it a perfect score because it wasn't an actual responsive app,3,Felt there was a lot of steps. Could've filled this stuff out later.
"On a scale of 1-5... how accurately did the questions/answers reflect your sense of humor? (1 being ""not accurately at all"", 5 being ""very accurately"")
FU: Was there any information you felt was particularly relevant? Irrelevant?
",4,"""I think the show one is definitely a good question. The meme one... there are just so many memes, so you can't distill it down to six options.""
People watch more short videos like TikToks than reading memes.
Comedians a good one. Platform is a good one.",4,"Options were limited, but I did get a choice and smiled at a few of them. It's hard to encapsulate everything in one entire person that way, but having a choice helped.
Memes were the best but would you rather prompt doesn't necessarily reflect your sense of humor.",2,"Favorite comedian question wasn't good. Meme question was good, but other questions weren't that reflective. Maybe ""who would you take on a dinner date?"" 
Shift from freestyle questions to more multiple choice is good.
Focus on response to humor.",3,Pretty close to my sense of humor. Would want it to be more open ended. ,1,"""If the humor that you're doing for is basic, horrible normy kind of humor (like the kind of people who think Friends is funny) then you did an excelent job. And I think those people are already on Hinge. If you're actually going for people who don't want a Hinge mainstream experience, and are actually looking to connect with humor, it could be to your benefit to have more niche memes and more niche comedians (like Eric Andre Show).""",4,"I think the memes reflect it the most, because it's niche and indicates what communities you're in.",1,The options were pretty basic. Memes would reflect my sense of humor if they were better.
"On a scale of 1-5... how helpful were the prompts to building your dating profile? (1 being ""not helpful at all"", 5 being ""very helpful"")
Please expand.",4,"""I think they were pretty good, because they're open ended and show off how funny you actually are""",5,The prompts are where your personality can shine.,3,Cool idea. Gave the open ended questions a bit more meat. Not everyone expresses themselves that way so it's good that there are multiple options.,4,Didn't have to think about what prompts to choose.,4,"The content in the prompts could be most specific. Think of totally bizarre prompts that would actually make somebody laugh. ""Older people that design apps for younger people are afriad to get too weird with it, and that's their greatest mistake. The things that actually make young people laugh is just weird bizarre shit.""",3,,1,"Prompts were not helpful, because I'm not good at writing prompts."

"On a scale of 1-5... how do you feel about this method of browsing potential dates (scroll instead of queue)? (1 being ""I did not enjoy it at all"", 5 being ""I enjoyed it a lot"")
Please expand.",5,"I like the scrolling because you can see multiple people at once. ""It's nice to have options right away""",5,"Is it a maximum limit?
I would prefer it to be limit per day (like 20) and they refresh every day",4,"Initially really enjoying it,  because it allows me to compare people without choosing them. Their descriptions are topical.",4,"I think it's nice to be able to see everyone. Any batch, I'm gonna pick the best two. Infinite scroll would be preferable.",3,"I like scrolling.
It feels more serious when you dislike someone. ",5,"""One of the most frustrating thing about dating apps is that you need to go one at a time. Sometime I see someone's profile and I don't know exactly how I feel about them, so I wish I could table a person.""
Maybe having ten people at a time and refreshing",3,"Would be cool if it was just a batch, and every time you X one out it gets replaced with another card."
"On a scale of 1-5... how helpful do you feel this browsing experience will be in finding a match? (1 being ""not helpful at all"", 5 being ""very helpful"")
Please expand.",3,"Would prefer batches of five at a time.
""I like that I know what their sense of humor is but other things are important to me too""",3,"Would enjoy the people you match with more, but would have the same browsing experience as with other apps.",3,"Might become frustrating faster than swiping would, because you don't feel like you're playing a game. The fact that you can contrast people will better help you find a match.",2,Not very much a factor,4,More helpful because you get to see everyone at once and compare people. ,5,I wouldn't want an infinite scroll,2,Would like it if the cards were smaller so more than two could fit above the fold.
"On a scale of 1-5... how prominent is the humor theme during the browsing process? (1 being ""not prominent at all"", 5 being ""very prominent"")
Please expand.",5,"""It's all about the humor""",5,The onboarding process put me in the mindset of thinking about humor and the tags on their profile made humor seem like a very big component.,3,"None of these responses are very original. 
She's interpreting the match info as responses.
Unreliable: maybe instead say ""he also gets his humor from TikTok""",2,Not super prominent. Don't think I'd read the recommendations.,2,"These little bios are kind of dumb because you're looking at the picture not the bio, because of how it's designed. 
Would be interesting to only see the bio up front and then see the picture second.
Small version of the photo on the card.",3,"I would like the humor to be more prominent than the photo. 
The memes in common is the most important.",5,"""The only non-typical thing that you see, so compared to other dating apps it's pretty prominent"""
,,,,,,,,I want to know her height and more non-humor information about her.,,,,,,
Icebreak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Goal; Schedule a live date,TRUE,,TRUE,"I would like the icebreak challenges to be based on a mutual thing we like (like the tag when browsing) or maybe something based on one of her likes that I don't have or vice versa
More individualized the better
Would want to be able to upload my own meme.
Both of us sending a meme at the same time is kind of strange, maybe we should be prompted one after another.
Maybe started by whoever didn't like the person first",FALSE,,FALSE,,TRUE,,TRUE,Andre Gulvey instead of Jeff Watson,TRUE,
Targets / Questions:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In terms of fun how would you rate the Icebreak challenge? (1 being ""not fun at all"", 5 being ""very fun"")
Please expand.",3,"Didn't think his meme was funny.
""Could start the conversation. I'm just not a huge fan of memes""",5,"A lot of the time it can be stressfu trying ot think of how to start a conversation, and you can share something about yourself.
""Turned something stressful into something fun""",4,You can upload your own memes!,4,"The concept could be fun, this exact on is pretty fun.",4,"""Dick pic central.""
Pictures should have to be verified and you have a group of verified pictures in your app.
But really liked the concept.",2,I missed the prompt of the challenge at first.,3,"""It's kind of interesting, but it's kind of like very specific and polarizing. The interting part is getting a visual prompt, and I kind of like that memes."""
"How did feel about the chat being locked until you complete the Icebreak challenge?
",,"""I like that. It's different from other apps, where people rarely actually answer the questions.""",,Didn't think about it much but I think it's fine. If I have low matches it maybe should be optional. I don't know how I'd feel about having to do it every single time.,,Definitely makes people put in more effort which is good. Fulfilling the challenege will make me think about them more.,,"Didn't care. Made no impact. I prefer it as an icebreaker. ""Icebreak Challenge"" is a weird name.",,"""I feel good about that""",,"If that's the shtick then... alright. It's not my favorite. It could be really fun, I think the design just doesn't communicate it well.",,"""There are dating apps that have prompts but then most people dont actually answer the prompt, so it's kind of an interesting way to force you to answer the prompt. I could see it being annoying if you don't want to answer a rpompt, but then you could just answer it shittily, I guess"""

I would love to see my rating.",1,,2,"""Do I see the rating that I got?""
