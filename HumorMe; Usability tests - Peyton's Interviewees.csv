Interview Questions,out of 5,,out of 5,,out of 5,,out of 5,
Goal; Complete your dating profile,FALSE,,,,,,,
Targets / Questions:,,,,,,,,
"On a scale of 1-5... how much did you enjoy the HumorMe onboarding process? (1 being ""I did not enjoy it at all"", 5 being ""I enjoyed it a lot"")
Please expand.",4,"Process is easy, idea is different, possibility to match with different people you normally wouldn't match with.",4,"I liked picking memes and what makes me laugh and the comedians. I don't know about the Fuck, Marry, Kill because it doesn't seem necessary. The prompts don't seem necessary so would like it to be optional",4,It's very different from other dating apps. Most just make you put in the same information so these features are new and have a lot of potential. I wish every option would be optional so I didn't have to answer all of them like religion or favorite comedian,3,"*Prefer not to say on religious beliefs* Would like to upload my own memes - maybe upload your own memes when you upload pictures? I liked the onboarding process, pretty easy. Liked the amount of options, don't want too many options. Diversity in memes are bad (""Facebook mom memes"")"
"On a scale of 1-5... how easy was it to achieve the goal of creating your dating profile? (1 being ""very difficult"", 5 being ""super easy"")
Please expand.",5,"Good amount of questions to ask someone without getting too personal, gives you an idea of who you are without asking uncomfortable questions",5,"Quick and simple, very easy to follow",5,"Seemed pretty similar to other apps, didn't ask too much but just enough to get a good sense of people you want to date",5,"Very easy granted I didn't have to think about anything, promopts are stressful because I have to choose what I think will give me the most matches. Liked that I could just use my instagram pictures and options for shows/comedians"
"On a scale of 1-5... how accurately did the questions/answers reflect your sense of humor? (1 being ""not accurately at all"", 5 being ""very accurately"")
FU: Was there any information you felt was particularly relevant? Irrelevant?
",3,I don't feel like I am a super funny person but I feel like I answered enough to get an idea of my personality and what I like. I feel like some people wouldn't enjoy some of the questions because some of the memes were outdated and some people may not like the TV shows,,"The memes that autopopulated were bland and old, I wish I could upload my own memes",,I'm a super funny person so I wish I could have uploaded my own memes! It seems like I was forced to choose the funniest option out of many bad jokes,4,TV shows & comedians & prompts show my personality but wish it was more customizable. Would prefer to upload up to 6 of my own memes because it shows MY personality. 
"On a scale of 1-5... how helpful were the prompts to building your dating profile? (1 being ""not helpful at all"", 5 being ""very helpful"")
Please expand.",4,"Prompts add personality and helped set up my dating profile, good amount of questions",,"Very helpful, instructions were clear and I knew where to go and how I was supposed to answer",,I wish there were more about your interests instead of just about memes. I understand wanting to find someone funny but it doesn't matter if someone is funny but is the complete opposite person from you with other views.,,"""Feels like a buzzfeed quiz"", prompts allow you to show your personality with the custom text box WANT: link a youtube, vine, or tiktok clip on my profile that describes me"
,,,,,,,,
Preview profile,,,,,,,,
Goal; Match with someone,TRUE,I like that there is a timeline and being able to see all ,,,,,,
Targets / Questions:,,,,,,,,
Is it clear what the 'Heart' and 'X' do?,TRUE,"Yes, very clear, very similar to Tinder/Bumble",,"Yes, very clear",,Yep! Made sense- just like Tinder even though I've never used Tinder,,"Yep, worldwide knowledge in the dating world what the heart and x do"
"On a scale of 1-5... how do you feel about this method of browsing potential dates (scroll instead of queue)? (1 being ""I did not enjoy it at all"", 5 being ""I enjoyed it a lot"")
Please expand.",5,I prefer this better than the swiping layout because it gives you more options and makes me more inclined to go to someone's profile and learn more about them,5,I like this better than other apps because it gives me more options and I can compare the guys side by side instead of only focusing on one guy at a time. Seems more efficient and saves time.,3,Seems interesting but I feel like I wouldn't ever use the X and instead I would just like whoever I find attractive and skip over people I don't like. Does the timeline update every time? Or do the same people stay on the timeline until you X them?,5,Gives me a comparison of what's out there and let's me go back to other people in case you accidentally press the X
"On a scale of 1-5... how helpful do you feel this browsing experience will be in finding a match? (1 being ""not helpful at all"", 5 being ""very helpful"")
Please expand.",,"If there are enough people on the app, I think this would be great to showing you more options and shows more possibilities are out there for me than the single person in front of me like on Tinder",3,"More helpful because you can see more people. Is it an infinite list or does it shuffle every time you X or heart someone? I prefer this over the swiping experience. Also depends how many people are on the app, would be boring if there are not a lot of options",3,It doesn't really matter to me. At the end of the day you are still doing the same thing of X'ing them or hearting them. Would hate to keep seeing the same people. I like that you can leave people and come back to them if you are indifferent about them though!,5,Nice to see the smilarities and I really like being able to compare all of my choices and saves me time in having to swipe through every person
"On a scale of 1-5... how prominent is the humor theme during the browsing process? (1 being ""not prominent at all"", 5 being ""very prominent"")
Please expand.",3,Would have to go back and look more deeply (so I take this that the user did not get enough exposure to the humor aspects),4,"Good amount, wish people had to make their own catch phrases or jokes so you could see how funny they REALLY are",4,"There are only three things: Name, job, and a joke, so yeah pretty prominent",,"I like that it shows a sneak preview and encourages me to go to their profile to explore more, but I like more at pictures first. Attractiveness comes first and humor comes second for me personally"

Icebreak,,,,,,,,
Goal; Schedule a live date,FALSE,,,,,,,
Targets / Questions:,,,,,,,,
"In terms of fun how would you rate the Icebreak challenge? (1 being ""not fun at all"", 5 being ""very fun"")
Please expand.",5,It's different and less awkward because you don't have to start the conversation yourself,4,"Something different, better than just guys sending you cheesy pickup lines or sliding into your DMs",4,"Good conversation starter, want to send my own memes",3,If I thought I could have a good conversation with them I would prefer to talk to them but I liked having a conversation starter
"How did feel about the chat being locked until you complete the Icebreak challenge?
",,"I think it's fine I didn't mind, I think it's a good way to get to know someone before starting the actual chat, maybe more questions or different prompts",,"I don't care either way, having both options would be better.",,Good because you can't get unsolicited messages or d*ck pics,,I liked it because it makes you start a conversation instead of just matching with someone and never actually talking
"On a scale of 1-5... how likely would you be to schedule a live date through the app? (1 being ""not likely at all"", 5 being 'very likely')
Please expand.",1,I wouldn't do a live chat right away but maybe after chatting for a while and getting to know the person better,0,Would never do that.... ever. Too antisocial and shy.,2,I don't even facetime people so videochatting is just weird for me. Cool feature though,5,Especially during Covid I would use this before meeting someone in person. Also a great feature for girls who are nervous a guy might be creepy and they don't want to meet them in person yet
Likelihood of scheduling private live date ,5,More likely,,3,,3,,5
Likelihood of scheduling invite-only live date,2,Less likely,,4,,2,,"4 - would be fun to have my friends ""vet"" guys with me and make sure they are normal"
Likelihood of scheduling public live date,1,Not likely at all,,0,,1,,1 - I'm not that outgoing and would probably embarass myself. I know people would use this though and think it could be funny like reality tv
"FU: If all ranked 0, ask what, if anything, would convince them use those features.",,"Not in my comfort zone, maybe after we knew each other more",,,,I would do it more if people weren't able to say random things in chat or make fun of you,,

Live date (Dater view),,,,,,,,
Goal; Navigate to live date,FALSE,,,,,,,
Targets / Questions:,,,,,,,,
"On a scale of 1-5... how do you feel about audience sending prompts? (1 being ""I don't like it"", 5 being ""I think it's very fun"")",5,I think that's awesome and I think it's super fun to have the audience controlling the conversation,4,"Would rather have people send prompts than just random chat for people to talk about us on our first date, could introduce bullying",4,I like the prompts and think it would be funny if there were some 18+ questions to make jokes about with the other person,5,"I think it's really fun, especially if both people are into being live so would be entertaining watch, keeps the conversation going"
"On a scale of 1-5... Do you feel rating your date adds value to this experience? (1 being ""It adds no value"", 5 being ""It adds a lot of value"")",2,I don't think we really need to rate our dates but maybe if it was a private option,,"No I don't want to know how people rated me, maybe if there was some benefit to your profile or it showed on your profile how many stars you have",,Not really... I would hate to think I was having a good talk with a girl just to get off and she rates me a one star?,,I would want to see if I was good and let guys know if they were funny but it would suck to get a bad rating. Maybe if it worked as an algorithm and helped find me better dates

Reminds me of reality tv",1,"I would never waste my time watching other people, I would only do it if my friend was on a date so I could mess around with them",5,"Reminds me of the bachelor, super cool idea"
"On a scale of 1-5... how do you feel about HumorMe's system for interacting with live prompts (i.e. nice, naughty and normal prompts)? (1 being ""I don't like them at all"", 5 being 'I like them a lot') 
Please expand.",,"I think they are really fun, and add a little more flavor and makes it unique to other apps",5,I like having categories of questions to pick from,5,"Seems like the only way, I wouldn't change them",4,"You can learn a lot from the prompts and how they answer the questions instead of having to ask your own questions,"
"On a scale of 1-5... having seen the live dates section, how likely woud you be to go on a public live date using the HumorMe app?  (1 being ""not likely at all"", 5 being 'very likely')

(1 being ""not accurately at all"", 5 being ""very accurately"")",4,"Wish the app had a brief bio, like prefernces for things, memes are fun but it's also a dating app that needs more personal questions",3,"Don't have any spots for actual personal information, I like the funny stuff but that seems to be the only info on the entire profile, this is a dating app so I want to know other interests besides what makes them laugh",3,I want to know more about girls besides the shows or memes they like so would like more questions about who they are and what other things they like,4,"Pretty accurate, like the layout - seems pretty similar to all other dating apps"

Close out questions,,,,,,,,
"On a scale of 1-5... how likely would you be to use this app? (1 being ""not likely at all"", 5 being ""extremely likely)
Please expand.",4,"It's a cool new idea that woulds attract more people my age, very unique",,"I like the social side of the app that we've never seen on dating apps before, I also like that you can meet with someone via live chat instead of meeting in person because for girls that can be very scary to meet guys in person",3,"Only if the finished product has more than just funny stuff, need to know more about other people",2,Would be a 3 if I was in a bigger city with a more diverse pool of users to choose from
